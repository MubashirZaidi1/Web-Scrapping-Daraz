Project Title: Daraz.pk Web Scraping using Selenium

Description:
This project aims to scrape product data from the Daraz.pk e-commerce platform using Selenium, a powerful automation tool for web browsers. Daraz.pk is one of the leading online marketplaces in Pakistan, offering a wide range of products across various categories such as electronics, fashion, home appliances, and more.

The web scraping script developed in this project will utilize Selenium to automate the process of navigating through the Daraz.pk website, accessing product pages, and extracting relevant information such as product names, prices, descriptions, ratings, and images. By scraping this data, users can gain insights into trends, pricing dynamics, and popular products on the platform.

Key Features:
1. Automated navigation: The Selenium script will automate the process of navigating through the Daraz.pk website, simulating user interactions such as clicking, scrolling, and searching.
2. Data extraction: The script will extract essential product data including names, prices, descriptions, ratings, and images from product pages.
3. Scalability: The script will be designed to handle large volumes of data, allowing users to scrape information from multiple product categories and pages.
4. Error handling: Error handling mechanisms will be implemented to ensure robustness and reliability, handling exceptions such as network errors and page load failures.
5. Data storage: Scraped data will be stored in structured formats such as CSV or JSON files for further analysis or integration with other applications.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip.
3. Configure the Selenium web driver for your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
4. Run the main script to initiate the web scraping process.
5. Customize the script parameters to scrape specific categories or refine data extraction options as needed.
6. Analyze the scraped data for insights or integrate it into other applications.

By open-sourcing this project on GitHub, developers and data enthusiasts can explore web scraping techniques, contribute improvements, and leverage the extracted data for various purposes such as market research, price comparison, and trend analysis in the e-commerce domain.
